# Key-Value Pair Identification Using Graph Theory(Code : MC001)

Greetings Everyone,

## INTRODUCTION
  The MC001 assignment focuses on the application of graph theory and machine learning to extract, visualize, and predict key-value pairs from unstructured data. By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR), text pre-processing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and 
  machine learning techniques, the project generates a graph highlighting relationships between key-value pairs in a sample bill image and predicts the accuracy of these relationships. This feature is integrated into a mobile application, allowing users to interactively 
  highlight key-value pairs within unstructured data.

## OBJECTIVE
  The primary objective is to develop a system that accurately identifies, visualizes, and predicts key-value pairs from an unstructured data using graph theory and machine learning. 
  The goals include:

* Extracting text from an image using OCR.
* Pre-processing the extracted text for analysis.
* Applying NER to identify key-value entities.
* Generating a graph to represent relationships between identified key-value pairs.
* Using machine learning to predict the accuracy of these relationships.
* Integrating the graph visualization and prediction feature into a mobile
application.

## Challenge Example
Consider a sample bill image containing various key-value pairs such as:

* Date: 2023-07-15
* Total Amount: $250.00
* Vendor: ABC Store
* Item List:
   1. Item1: $50.00
   2. Item2: $200.00
The challenge is to accurately extract these key-value pairs, pre-process the data,
recognize entities, generate a graph that represents the relationships between these
pairs, and predict the accuracy of these relationships using machine learning.

## Technological Requirements
* OCR Technology: Tesseract OCR
* Text Pre-processing Tools: NLTK
* NER Tools: Stanza
* Graph Theory Libraries: Network, Matplotlib and Ploty
* Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Random Forest Regression
* Mobile Application Development Tools: React Native

## System Specifications
* Processor: Minimum quad-core processor
* RAM: Minimum 8GB
* Storage: Minimum 256GB SSD
* Operating System: Windows 7 or macOS 10.
* Development Environment: Python 3.8+, Android Studio/React Native

## Expected Outcomes
1. Successful extraction of text from sample bill images.
2. Effective pre-processing and normalization of the extracted text.
3. Accurate identification of key-value pairs using NER.
4. Generation of a graph that correctly represents relationships between key-value
pairs.
5. Prediction of the accuracy of these relationships using machine learning.
6. Integration of the graph visualization and prediction feature into a mobile
application through lens.
